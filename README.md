### Pwned: How Often Are Americans' Online Accounts Breached?

We merge data from a large representative sample from YouGov (n = 5,000) with data from [Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)](https://haveibeenpwned.com) to estimate how often people's information is exposed. And how that varies by race, education, income, and age.

We find that at least 82.8\% of Americans have had their accounts breached at least once. And that on average Americans' accounts have been breached at least thrice. Better educated, the middle-aged, women, and Whites and Blacks are more likely to have had their accounts breached than the complementary groups.

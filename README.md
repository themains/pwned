### Pwned: How Often Are Americans' Online Accounts Breached?

We merge data from a large representative sample from YouGov (n = 5,000) with data from https://haveibeenpwned.com to assess the extent to which an average American's credentials are exposed in some of the biggest public breaches. and how that exposure varies by race, education, income, and age.

News about large online breaches is increasingly common. Until now, however, there has been little good data on how exposed an average person is because of these breaches. We combine data from a large, representative sample of adult Americans (n = 5,000) with data from Have I Been Pwned to estimate the lower bound of the number of online accounts of an average American that have been breached. We find that at least 82.84\% of Americans have had their accounts breached. And that on average Americans' accounts have been breached at least thrice. Better educated, the middle-aged, women, and Whites and Blacks are more likely to have had their accounts breached than the complementary groups.
